# React Portfolio V1

## Description 
Being a web developer means being part of a community. You’ll need a place not only to share your projects while you're applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also to share your work with other developers and collaborate on projects.

Your task is to create a portfolio using your new React skills, which will help set you apart from other developers whose portfolios don’t use the latest technologies.

You’ll deploy this application to Netlify. Follow the instructions in the Git Guide or consult the [Docs on Netlify](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html#netlify) to create a build that you can deploy.
